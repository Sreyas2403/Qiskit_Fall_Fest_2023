## What is this Qiskit Fall Fest?
The Qiskit Fall Fest is a global series of quantum computing events organized and run by students on college campuses worldwide. These events aim to foster quantum computing knowledge and skills within local communities.

## Event Details
- Date: 17th October 2023
- Venue: LT1
- Timings: 6:30pm - 8:30pm

## IF USING IBM QUANTUM LAB
You’re ready to begin! Watch the video included in this repository for instructions on how to 
upload the notebooks and also get your images working properly.

## IF USING A HOSTED JUPYTER ENVIRONMENT 
OTHER THAN IBM QUANTUM (e.g., Google Colab)
Upload the notebooks and images into the hosted Jupyter environment
In the top code cell of one of the notebook, please run the following code to install the 
grader and Qiskit:
``` !pip install 'qc-grader[qiskit] @ git+https://github.com/qiskit-community/Quantum-Challenge-Grader.git'```

Follow your hosted Jupyter environment's instructions for uploading notebooks to 
upload all the Qiskit Fall Fest Challenges notebooks.

## IF RUNNING LOCALLY
### Prerequisites:
You should have a Python 3.10 or greater virtual environment
### Install:
You need to install our grader client, Qiskit, and Jupyter Lab to successfully run the 
notebooks.
From a terminal window in your Python virtual environment, run one of these 
commands:
- If you need to install the grader client, Qiskit, and Jupyter Lab run:
 ```pip install 'qc-grader[qiskit,jupyter] @ git+https://github.com/qiskit-community/Quantum-Challenge-Grader.git'```
- If you already have Jupyter Lab in your Python virtual environment and only need to 
install the grader client and Qiskit then run:
``` pip install 'qc-grader[qiskit] @ git+https://github.com/qiskit-community/Quantum-Challenge-Grader.git'```
- If you already have Jupyter Lab and Qiskit (version 0.44.0 or greater) installed in your 
Python virtual environment and only need to install the grader client then run:
 ```pip install 'git+https://github.com/qiskit-community/Quantum-Challenge-Grader.git'```

### Run:
From a terminal window in your Python virtual environment
Change to the directory where all the Qiskit Fall Fest Challenges notebooks reside. For 
example:
```cd ~/Qiskit-Fall-Fest-Challenges-Notebooks```

### Launch Jupyter Lab:
```jupyter lab .```

This should launch your Jupyter Lab instance in a new browser window showing the 
Qiskit Fall Fest Challenges notebooks
